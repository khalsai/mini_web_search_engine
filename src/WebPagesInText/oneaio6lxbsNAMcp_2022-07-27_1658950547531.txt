Please read up on the protection policy. Full protection is used to stop edit warring between multiple users or to prevent vandalism to high-risk templates; semi-protection and pending changes are usually used only to prevent IP and new user vandalism (see the rough guide to semi-protection); and move protection is used to stop pagemove revert wars. Extended confirmed protection is used where semi-protection has proved insufficient (see the rough guide to extended confirmed protection) After a page has been protected, the protection is listed in the page history and logs with a short description indicating why it was protected, and the article is listed on Special:Protectedpages. Further discussion should take place on the Talk page of the article. In the case of full protection due to edit warring, admins do not revert to specific versions of the page, except to get rid of obvious vandalism. Note: Editors should not consider requesting page protection as a method for continuing an argument from elsewhere nor as a venue for starting a new discussion regarding article content. If a request contains excessive argument, appears to be intended to resolve a content dispute, includes personal attacks or uncivil comments, or has any other unrelated discussion, it will be removed from this page and no action will be taken.

Well, well, well, what's the probability that two Italians who aren't WP:MEAT are awake in the same night at the same obscure article, both removing the PROD? tgeorgescu (talk) 03:07, 27 July 2022 (UTC) First PROD removal, second PROD removal. Guess you can find my first block here. That's really hard detective work to find out I was block evading the second time. I have no idea who you though I was the first time or why you aren't reverting obvious block evasions like this one as fast as the first supposed one, but I'll leave the Dietary acid load article alone, so there is, I believe, no need to protect it, at least not because of these two IP edits by me or for fear of other edits by my now block evading personas. 109.119.212.245 (talk) 04:16, 27 July 2022 (UTC) Automated comment: One or more pages in this request appear to already be protected. Please confirm.—cyberbot ITalk to my owner:Online 18:14, 27 July 2022 (UTC) Semi-protected for a period of 10 days, after which the page will be automatically unprotected. @Alexf: @Acroterion: You blocked the other two IP addresses. Just FYI. Recent change by IP to dietary acid load is an improvement, so did not do the WP:DENY revert. ~Anachronist (talk) 18:27, 27 July 2022 (UTC) Jake Virtanen Jake Virtanen (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Semi-protection: Persistent vandalism – vandalism.

Anarchyte (talk) 15:01, 27 July 2022 (UTC) Stepan Bandera Stepan Bandera (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Reason: Edit wars in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. One user in particular seems to be causing most of the issues, but the page will get even more attention with recent articles in Vogue and the Atlantic. Page should be reverted to the first edit of 05:19, 25 February 2022? (the day of the invasion and right before the edit war began). Protection needs to remain until things settle down. Charlesblack (talk) 15:23, 27 July 2022 (UTC) A note to others that the article is already semi-protected indefinitely, so this editor is probably requesting an increase in the level of protection, not its introduction.

Sahaib (talk) 18:26, 27 July 2022 (UTC) Karen people Karen people (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Reason: Requesting temporary semi-protection due to a high volume of unsourced edits by anonymous users in recent days. Here I reverted unsourced changes to population numbers, an edit for which I immediately received emails from throwaway accounts complaining about the revert of "very real and true numbers" (quoted from one of the emails). There have also been some odd unexplained reverts by anonymous users as well. Here an anonymous editor restores a bad version of the article with non-sensical English phrasing and repetitions of the full name of an organisation instead of the abbreviation. I'm pretty sure 50.192.149.153 and 98.242.192.79 (as well as the person who flooded my email) are the same person given that they restore each other's edits to Karen people, and that they have a specific editing focus on articles related to Christian figures. However, to my knowledge, sockpuppetry procedures don't apply to IP addresses.
